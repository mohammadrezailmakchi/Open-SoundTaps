# 🎵 SoundTAPS Legacy

Welcome to **SoundTAPS Legacy** – a minimal, all-in-one audio player built with ❤️ in Python and [Flet](https://flet.dev).  
This is the **first-generation prototype** of the SoundTAPS project — a local music player that's lightweight, easy to run, and packed with future potential.

---

## 📦 About This Version

- ✅ **Self-contained**: All logic is packed into a single `main.py` file for now.
- 🧪 **Test-ready**: Just drop your songs into the `songs/` folder and you're good to go!
- ⚙️ **Simple to run**: One click with `run.bat` sets up everything for you — including dependencies.

> ⚠️ You must have Python 3.10+ installed on your system.
